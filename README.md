# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction System

A Machine Learning-based web application that predicts the resale price of used cars based on various attributes like make, model, year, mileage, and fuel type. Built using Python, Scikit-learn, Flask, and a user-friendly web interface.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Estimating the resale value of a car is often complex due to factors like brand, mileage, fuel type, and condition. This project uses machine learning algorithmsâ€”Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regressionâ€”to provide accurate and consistent car price predictions. The aim is to support buyers, sellers, and dealers with a transparent, automated tool for car valuation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Input parameters: Car brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type
- Predicts current and future resale value (e.g., after 2 years)
- User-friendly GUI using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend built with Flask for real-time predictions
- Trained on cleaned and preprocessed historical data
- Stores predictions in MySQL for tracking and future use

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models Used

- *Linear Regression:* Baseline model; easy to interpret but limited with non-linear data.
- *Random Forest:* Ensemble method using decision trees; reduces overfitting and improves accuracy.
- *Gradient Boosting:* Combines weak learners for strong predictive power on complex patterns.

---

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics

- *RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):* 4.5%
- *MAE (Mean Absolute Error):* Low error rates across all models
- *RÂ² Score:* 0.92 (Random Forest & Gradient Boosting)
